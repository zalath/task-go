# Easy task manager backend

- go-gin/go-sqlite3

### Target
- task recording
- Set state mark(tik for tick)
- Tree structure
- Keywords, not yet, giving some keywords to each task to group them
- Search, not yet, I want to learn full-text search
- Time control, not yet, to form gantt chart, make out a big task's timeline

### Something to say
- just for go practice
- this is only a backend, I'm going to make some faces in different language for learning.
